**README: 
AGORA Replication Study**

**Introduction**

This README provides instructions for setting up and executing the replication study of the AGORA approach for generating test oracles for REST APIs. The goal is to validate the effectiveness and generalizability of AGORA as reported in the original research.

**Objective**

To replicate and validate the findings of the original AGORA study, focusing on the automated generation of test oracles for REST APIs, assessing precision, recall, and fault detection capabilities.

**Our Research Questions:**

a. How does the performance of AGORA scale with larger datasets of API requests and responses? Are there any bottlenecks in the system as the dataset size increases?

b. How does detecting and reducing duplicate input requests affect the performance of AGORA's API testing process? (Data deduplication using threshold value)

**Prerequisites**

Access to the replication package provided by the original authors.

Python and Java installed on your machine.

Access to the specified REST APIs for testing.

A suitable environment for running virtual machines, if required.

**Setup Instructions** **Replication Package:**

**Virtual Machine Setup:** 
If a VM is used, set it up according to the provided configurations to ensure consistency with the original study.

**Tool Installation:** 
Install Daikon, Beet, and any other required tools as specified in the original study.

**API Setup:** 
Ensure access to the same set of APIs used in the original study, or select comparable alternatives if necessary.
